Realistically the only data that we need to collect for this first iteration of the project is the Date, Time, Open, High, Low, Close data. 
Everything else can be ignored when collecting data including volume.
Things may need to change as I work work on more ensembling techniques.
The buy price/trade initiation price (can take short positions) will be the close price of the last candle in the image.

Example:
Image 1 will be created using row 2 (date: 11/20/2023, Time: 13:00:00, etc.) through row 16 (date: 11/20/2023, Time: 13:28:00, etc.)
*Note* Row 16 will be considered the "Trade Initiation Candle", this is the final candle in the sequence where we predict buy, sell, do nothing

Trade Initiation Price = 15893 (Close_2m of row 16)
Trade Close Price = 15896.25 (Close_2m of row 19, which is 6 minutes after Trade Initiation Candle)
*Note* For simplicity we are assuming we hold for 6 minutes and close the trade regardless, no stop loss, holding for longer, etc. 
Trade Returns = Trade Close Price - Trade Initiation Price
